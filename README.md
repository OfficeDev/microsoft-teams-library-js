Welcome to the Teams client library monorepo! For breaking changes, please refer to our [changelog](./packages/teams-js/CHANGELOG.md) in the `<root>/packages/teams-js` directory. This repository contains the core teams-js package as well as tools and applications for analyzing and testing.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repo
2. Run `pnpm install` from repo root
3. Run `pnpm build` from repo root
4. To run Unit tests, run `pnpm test`

NOTE: Make sure `pnpm@7.30.1` is installed as a global tool, by running `npm install -g pnpm@7.30.1`.  

TIP: whenever building or testing the Teams client library, you can run `pnpm build` or `pnpm test` from the `packages/teams-js` directory.
