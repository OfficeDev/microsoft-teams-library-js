# Microsoft Teams JavaScript client library

Welcome to the Teams JavaScript client library! For breaking changes, please refer to our [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) in the current `<root>/packages/teams-js` directory.

This JavaScript library is part of the [Microsoft Teams developer platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/). See full [library reference documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/javascript/api/overview/msteams-client?view=msteams-client-js-latest).

## Getting Started

See [instructions](../../README.md#Getting-Started) in the monorepo root for how to clone and build the repository.

Whenever building or testing the Teams client library, you can run `pnpm build` or `pnpm test` from the packages/teams-js directory.

## Installation

To install the stable [version](https://learn.microsoft.com/javascript/api/overview/msteams-client?view=msteams-client-js-latest):

### npm

`npm install --save @microsoft/teams-js`

### pnpm

`pnpm add @microsoft/teams-js`

### Production

You can reference these files directly [from here](https://res.cdn.office.net/teams-js/2.15.0/js/MicrosoftTeams.min.js) or point your package manager at them.

## Usage

### As a package

Install either using npm or pnpm.

**If you are using any dependency loader** such as [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) or [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs) or module bundler such as [browserify](http://browserify.org/), [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), you can use `import` syntax to import specific modules. For e.g.

```typescript
import { app } from '@microsoft/teams-js';
```

### As a script tag

Reference the library inside of your `.html` page using:

```html
<!-- Microsoft Teams JavaScript API (via CDN) -->
<script
  src="https://res.cdn.office.net/teams-js/2.15.0/js/MicrosoftTeams.min.js"
  integrity="sha384-fTDbgjG+RKtC2IyKV3r1o0xdxY4oV1v53uPHwPJTmTddvDm2ats9JWRAbtouZx4C"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>

<!-- Microsoft Teams JavaScript API (via npm) -->
<script src="node_modules/@microsoft/teams-js@2.15.0/dist/MicrosoftTeams.min.js"></script>

<!-- Microsoft Teams JavaScript API (via local) -->
<script src="MicrosoftTeams.min.js"></script>
```

### Dependencies

Teams client library depends on [`Promise`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) type. If you support older browsers and devices which may not yet provide it natively (e.g. IE 11), you need to provide a global polyfill, such as [es6-promise](https://www.npmjs.com/package/es6-promise), in your bundled application. If you're using a script tag to reference the Teams client library, you need to make sure the polyfill is included and initialized before the Teams client library is initialized.

## Full Documentation and Examples

While each interface, class, function, etc. includes compact developer documentation, full documentation about library usage, including examples, can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/overview/msteams-client?view=msteams-client-js-latest).

## Testing

The [Teams Test App](https://aka.ms/teams-test-app) is used to validate the Teams client library APIs.

## Troubleshooting

If the CDN hash value on the npm page is out of date please refer to [here] (https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-library-js/blob/main/packages/teams-js/README.md) for an up to date version. If you notice this problem, please report that issue to us in [GitHub Issues] (https://github.com/OfficeDev/microsoft-teams-library-js/issues)
