### Breaking changes

#### The Teams JavaScript client SDK repo is now a monorepo

We utilized [Yarn Workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/) to turn our repo into a monorepo. The files specific to the Teams client SDK have been moved to an inner directory
with the name `teams-js`. A new TeamsJS Test App for validating the Teams client SDK has been added in the <root>/apps/teams-test-app location.

#### Several API functions have been moved and renamed

Organized top-level library functions under a core namespace. For example, `shareDeepLink` has been moved under `core` namespace.
Using `import * as ... from ...` will now fail. Importing now follows the following convention:

```typescript
import { core } from '@microsoft/teams-js';
```

For more detailed API organization, please refer to the **Capabilities organization introduced** section below.

#### Support for `hostName` added to Context interface

The name of the host the app is running in is now part of the application context in the `hostName` property.

#### Several meeting APIs changes

meeting.requestStartLiveStreaming and meeting.requestStopLiveStreaming no longer take in the parameter liveStreamState.

#### Context interface changes

The Context interface has been updated to group similar properties for better scalability in a multi-host environment.

#### FrameContext changes

FrameContext's user.tenant.sku has been renamed to user.tenant.teamsSku to reflect that it is used by Teams for a different purpose than from the Graph API's user.tenant.sku's.
The `FrameContext` interface has been renamed `FrameInfo`.

#### appEntity.selectAppEntity now takes in an additional parameter and the callback has reversed parameters with one one of them becoming optional.

```
selectAppEntity(
    threadId: string,
    categories: string[],
    callback: (appEntity: AppEntity, sdkError?: SdkError) => void,
  ): void
```

is now:

```
selectAppEntity(
    threadId: string,
    categories: string[],
    subEntityId: string,
    callback: (sdkError?: SdkError, appEntity?: AppEntity) => void,
  ): void
```

#### threadId parameter removed from callback passed into teams.refreshSiteUrl()

```
refreshSiteUrl(threadId: string, callback: (threadId: string, error: SdkError) => void): void
```

is now:

```
refreshSiteUrl(threadId: string, callback: (error: SdkError) => void): void
```
