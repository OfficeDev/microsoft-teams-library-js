## 2.0.0

Fri, 13 May 2022 22:32:13 GMT

### Major changes

- Promote 2.0.0 beta changes to stable. TeamsJS can be used to write applications with support in multiple Microsoft 365 hosts, including Teams, Outlook, and Office.

- Reverted `registerEnterSettingsHandler` back to its original name `registerChangeSettingsHandler`
- Removed deprecated `stageView.open` function that took a callback as a parameter
- Modified `enablePrintCapability` to correctly require the library be initialized before using it

- The Teams JavaScript client SDK repo has been converted to a monorepo

  - We utilized [Yarn Workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/) to turn our repo into a monorepo. <br> The files specific to the Teams client SDK have been moved to an inner directory with the name `teams-js`
  - A new TeamsJS Test App for validating the Teams client SDK has been added in the <root>/apps/teams-test-app location.

- Several API functions have been moved and renamed. For more detailed API organization, please refer to the **Capabilities organization introduced** section below.

- Support for `hostName` added to Context interface. The name of the host the app is running in is now part of the application context in the `hostName` property.

- Context interface changes <br>
  The Context interface has been updated to group similar properties for better scalability in a multi-host environment.

- FrameContext changes <br>
  FrameContext's `user.tenant.sku` has been renamed to `user.tenant.teamsSku` to reflect that it is used by Teams for a different purpose than from the Graph API's user.tenant.sku's.
  The `FrameContext` interface has been renamed `FrameInfo`.

- Task/Dialog changes <br>

  - The top-level `dialog` capability supports HTML-based dialogs and a `dialog.bot` sub-capability has been added for bot-based dialogs. At this time, `dialog` does not support adaptive card-based dialogs,
  - `dialog.open` takes a `UrlDialogInfo` parameter instead of `DialogInfo` to enforce only HTML based dialogs,
  - `submitHandler` callback takes a single object parameter containing both error and result,
  - `dialog.open` takes one more optional parameter named `messageFromChildHandler` which is triggered if dialog sends a message to the app,
  - `dialog.open` returns a function that can be used to send messages to the dialog instead of returning a `ChildAppWindow`,
  - `dialog.bot.open` has the same function signature except it takes `BotUrlDialogInfo` instead of `UrlDialogInfo`
  - Moved `dialog.resize()` function to a new `update` sub-capability and is now `dialog.update.resize()`. The parameter has been changed to `DialogSize` type
  - Removed `PostMessageChannel` returned from `dialog.open`, added separate function `sendMessageToDialog` to make up for missing functionality
  - The type `PostMessageChannel` and `sendMessageToParentFromDialog` function in `dialog` capability have been updated to no longer take callback parameters.

- Capabilities organization introduced
