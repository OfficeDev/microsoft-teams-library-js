## 2.2.0

Wed, 03 Aug 2022 19:21:51 GMT

### Minor changes

- Added an optional error object to `ISpeakingState` interface to align `registerSpeakingStateChangeHandler` API with other API error handling.

- Split single `CloudStorageProviderFile` action API into 3 action APIs

### Patches

- Added clarifying comment to `dialog.submit` to indicate the dialog is closed when `submit` is called.
- Updated reference documentation links for deprecated global `Context` interface to work with typedoc system.
- Added `FrameContexts.task` to `openChat` and `openGroupChat` in chat.ts
- Added `@beta` tags to new content action-related interfaces.
- Exported publicly documented global interfaces to enable use outside the SDK.

## 2.1.0

Fri, 22 Jul 2022 16:36:44 GMT

### Minor changes

- Added `webStorage` capability with APIs to allows apps to discover if web storage is supported by the host client
- Added 3P cloud storage provider API support to files.ts
- Added `isSupported` to `stageView`
- Added `profile.showProfile` API and unit tests
- Added `meeting.registerMeetingReactionReceivedHandler`
- Added `scanBarCode` to barCode.ts from media.ts along with permission APIs `hasPermission` and `requestPermission`
- Added a new capability `geoLocation` that split the location capability into new set of functions and subcapabilities. Added permission-related APIs `hasPermission` and `requestPermission`.

### Patches

- Fixed broken SDK reference documentation links and added SDK reference documentation validation to build step.

- Added frameless unit tests for `authentication.notifySuccess` and `authentication.notifyFailure`
- Added beta tag to `barCode` capability to accurately reflect level of support offered
- Added `meeting.registerRaiseHandStateChangedHandler`
- Updated reference documentation for global deprecated `Context` interface. Each deprecated `Context` property now links to respective mapped property in `app.Context` interface.
- Enabled `FrameContexts.task` for `startCall` API in call.ts
- Fixed formatting of reference documentation for `call.StartCallParams` interface.
- Removing unnecessary `/` in `appInstallDialog.openAppInstallDialog()`
- Renamed `IRaiseHandStateChangedEvent` interface to `IRaiseHandStateChangedEventData` and changed the error so it can be assigned undefined rather than null

## 2.0.0-beta.0

### Major changes

- The Teams JavaScript client SDK repo is now a monorepo

  - We utilized [Yarn Workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/) to turn our repo into a monorepo. <br> The files specific to the Teams client SDK have been moved to an inner directory with the name `teams-js`
  - A new TeamsJS Test App for validating the Teams client SDK has been added in the <root>/apps/teams-test-app location.

- Several API functions have been moved and renamed. <br>
  Organized top-level library functions under a core namespace. For example, `shareDeepLink` has been moved under `core` namespace. <br> Using `import * as ... from ...` will now fail. Importing now follows the following convention: <br>

  ```ts
  import { core } from '@microsoft/teams-js';
  ```

  For more detailed API organization, please refer to the **Capabilities organization introduced** section below.

- Support for `hostName` added to Context interface <br>
  The name of the host the app is running in is now part of the application context in the `hostName` property.

- Several meeting APIs changes <br>
  `meeting.requestStartLiveStreaming` and `meeting.requestStopLiveStreaming` no longer take in the parameter liveStreamState.

- Context interface changes <br>

  - The Context interface has been updated to group similar properties for better scalability in a multi-host environment.
  - Context's `user.tenant.sku` has been renamed to `user.tenant.teamsSku` to reflect that it is used by Teams for a different purpose than from the Graph API's user.tenant.sku's.

- FrameContext changes <br>
  The `FrameContext` interface has been renamed `FrameInfo`.

- appEntity.selectAppEntity now takes in an additional parameter and the callback has reversed parameters with one one of them becoming optional.
  ```
  selectAppEntity(
    threadId: string,
    categories: string[],
    callback: (appEntity: AppEntity, sdkError?: SdkError) => void,
  ): void
  ```
  is now:
  ```
  selectAppEntity(
    threadId: string,
    categories: string[],
    subEntityId: string,
    callback: (sdkError?: SdkError, appEntity?: AppEntity) => void,
  ): void
  ```
- threadId parameter removed from callback passed into teams.refreshSiteUrl()

  ```
  refreshSiteUrl(threadId: string, callback: (threadId: string, error: SdkError) => void): void
  ```

  is now:

  ```
  refreshSiteUrl(threadId: string, callback: (error: SdkError) => void): void
  ```
