 * - {@link pages.currentApp.navigateTo} for navigating to a section of your own app
 * - {@link pages.navigateToApp} for navigating to other apps besides your own
 *
 * Many areas of functionality previously provided by deep links are now handled by strongly-typed functions in capabilities.
 * If your app is using a deep link to trigger these specific components, use the strongly-typed alternatives.
 * For example (this list is not exhaustive):
 * - To open an app installation dialog, use the {@link appInstallDialog} capability
 * - To start a call, use the {@link call} capability
 * - To open a chat, use the {@link chat} capability
 * - To open a dialog, use the {@link dialog} capability
 * - To create a new meeting, use the {@link calendar.composeMeeting} function
 * - To open a Stage View, use the {@link stageView} capability
 *
 * In each of these capabilities, you can use the `isSupported()` function to determine if the host supports that capability.
 * When using a deep link to trigger these components, there's no way to determine whether the host supports it.
 *
 * For more information on crafting deep links to the host, see [Configure deep links](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/deep-links)

 * does not necessarily indicate whether the target loaded successfully.
