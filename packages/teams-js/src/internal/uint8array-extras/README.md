This package is a stripped out version of the [uint8arrays-extras](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uint8array-extras) package, containing only the functionality used by teams-js. Itis being directly included in the library instead of an NPM package due to a Jest issue preventing its usage, which is solved by transpiling the file ourselves. This package is used to replace the `Buffer` package as this is both treeshakable and browser-compatible, so we no longer need to polyfill `browser`, which is quite size intensive. This provides a much more space-efficient method to providing the needed functionality.
