    "1. Dialog capability has been split into a main capability (dialog) for supporting HTML-based dialogs and a subcapability dialog.bot for bot based dialogs. For now, dialog capability does not support adaptive card based dialogs",
    "\n  2. dialog.open has been changed to take UrlDialogInfo instead of DialogInfo to enforce only HTML based dialogs",
    "\n  3. dialog.open takes an extra optional parameter named messageFromChildHandler which is triggered if dialog sends a message to the app",
    "\n  4. dialog.open returns a function that can be used to send messages to the dialog instead of returning a ChildAppWindow",
    "\n  5. dialog.bot.open has the same function signature except it takes BotUrlDialogInfo instead of UrlDialogInfo"
