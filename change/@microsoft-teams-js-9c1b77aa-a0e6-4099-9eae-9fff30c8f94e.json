    "1. Dialog capability has been split into a main capability (dialog) for supporting HTML-based dialogs and a subcapability dialog.bot for bot based dialogs. For now, dialog capability does not support adaptive card based dialogs",
    "\n  2. dialog.open takes a UrlDialogInfo instead of DialogInfo to enforce only HTML based dialogs",
    "\n  3. callback submitHandler takes a single object parameter containing both error and result",
    "\n  4. dialog.open takes one more optional parameter named messageFromChildHandler which is triggered if dialog sends a message to the app",
    "\n  5. dialog.open returns a function that can be used to send messages to the dialog instead of returning a ChildAppWindow",
    "\n  6. dialog.bot.open has the same function signature except it takes BotUrlDialogInfo instead of UrlDialogInfo"
